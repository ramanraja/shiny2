<h1> A Tiny Shiny Application </h1>
<h2> By Raman Raja </h2>
This application performs linear modeling. <br/>
It uses the built-in data set <emph>mtcars</emph> in R.<br/>
A model fit is made between mpg (Miles Per Gallon) at wt (The weight of the car). <br/>
A scatter plot is made between these two variables. <br/>
There are two choice of models:
<li> Linear Model </li>
<li> Quadratic Model </li>
Choose one of the models using the radio button. <br/>
The model curve is plotted on top of the scatter plot in red.<br/>
The least squares error is printed on the graph itself. <br/>
We see that the quadratic model is a better fit to the data, and the least squares error gets smallar.
